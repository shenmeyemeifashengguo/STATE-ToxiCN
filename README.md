# STATE ToxiCN: A Benchmark for Span-level Target-Aware Toxicity Extraction in Chinese Hate Speech Detection

We will be hosting an evaluation at CCL2025, and to ensure the fairness of the competition, only 4,000 data entries are currently open-sourced. The complete dataset will be made public after the competition concludes. Everyone is welcome to sign up for CCL2025 Task 10: Fine-Grained Chinese Hate Speech Detection Evaluation.
